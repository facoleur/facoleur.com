User Flows - mapped how users could manipulate data, build pipelines, and visualize insights.\n2. Wireframes and Iterations - explored different interaction models for complex data tasks.\n3. UI Design - expanded the design system while maintaining visual consistency.\n4. Collaboration - continuous feedback loops with developers to balance usability with technical feasibility.\n\n(Add visuals: user flows, wireframes, UI mockups, design system snippets)\n\n## Outcome and Impact\n\n- Shifted MiPasa from code-first to a no-code accessible platform.\n- Enabled users to:\n  - Manipulate data without writing code.\n  - Build complex multi-charts visually.\n  - Create data pipelines through UI interactions.\n- Improved design consistency and scalability via an updated design system.\n- Had a real impact on product usability and adoption.\n\n## Learnings\n\n- How to adapt to an existing design system and expand it with consistency.\n- Designing complex technical features in a user-friendly way.\n- Navigating the trade-offs between developer constraints and usability.\n\n## Visuals (to add)\n\n- Before vs. After screenshots.\n- User flow diagrams.\n- Examples of redesigned components.\n- Dashboards, pipeline builder UI, or chart creation screens.\n",
