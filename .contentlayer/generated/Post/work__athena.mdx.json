The stack includes Tailwind CSS for styling, Axios with a custom fetcher, React Query for data fetching and caching, Recharts for charts, TanStack Table for datatables, Radix UI for components, and Zustand for state management.\n\n![Charts](/assets/athena/single.jpg)\n\n## Technical details\n\n#### Backend integration\n\nThe backend was built with Django, which returned snake_case keys. To align with established TypeScript conventions, I implemented a custom Axios instance with interceptors that converted keys to camelCase on the fly, while handling exceptions such as Django's nested filter keys using double underscores.\n\n#### Filtering system and data tables\n\nTo enable efficient search across hundreds of products, I built a flexible filtering system with multiple combinable filters, managed through a [Zustand store](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) and synchronized with the UI. I also developed a reusable filter component that supported number, text, select, multiselect, and boolean filters, automatically adapting its behavior to the filter type.\n\n![Charts](/assets/athena/filters.jpg)\n\nI implemented a full featured datatable with column visibility, pagination and global search. The datatable was integrated with [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to manage loading states and cache data, and to invalidate queries when filters or parameters changed.\n\n#### Charts\n\nI first implemented charts with Plotly but later refactored to [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for better integration with React. I built custom chart components supporting multi line, bar, grouped bar, and scatter charts, with attention to responsiveness and interactivity. Chart data was cached when possible using React Query.\n\n![Charts](/assets/athena/charts.jpg)\n\n#### Authentication and roles\n\nAthena supports customer, admin, and sales roles. The sales role was a custom role with backoffice access to supplier data across marketplaces.\n\n#### Testing\n\nI wrote unit tests for critical components using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), focusing on the filtering system, datatable, and chart components. End to end testing was handled with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) in a separate repository, integrated with CI/CD to run on every push and send notifications to Slack.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nAthena's frontend brought together complex data handling, interactive visualization, and role based access into a single application, making it a reliable tool for managing products and pricing on Swiss marketplaces.\n",
