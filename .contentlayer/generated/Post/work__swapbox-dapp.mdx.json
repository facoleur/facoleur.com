It is an essential component of Swapbox; used to deploy a Swapbox smart contract, choose a stablecoin used as liquidity, configure the fee rates, link and unlink machines, set transaction limits, explore detailed analytics, etc.\n\n### Understanding user needs and flows\n\nThe Swapbox admin dApp is a complex platform that serves as the primary interface for Swapbox operators.
