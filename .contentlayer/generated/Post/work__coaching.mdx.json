    "raw": "\nIn **early 2025**, I began working with **Inartis** as a coach during **Cezar Ritz’s Innovation Week**. Later, in the **mid-to-late 2025**, I was invited to coach at **IMD’s Innovation Week**, supporting company teams on more advanced challenges.\n\n![Coaching at Inartis & IMD Innovation Weeks](/assets/coaching/coaching.jpeg)\nThe photo was taken during a meal offered by 42 school at a “repas de soutiens.” Unfortunately, I do not have photos of the coaching sessions themselves.\n\n## Inartis (Cezar Ritz Colleges Innovation Week)\n\nAt Inartis, I coached students as they transformed initial ideas into structured business concepts. My contributions included:\n\n- Refining **ideas, products, and positioning**\n- Designing **visuals, pitch decks, and storytelling**\n- Prototyping early **apps and digital solutions** to bring ideas to life\n\nI typically worked with **3–4 teams per day**, guiding them through short cycles of feedback and rapid iteration. Using **Canva**, **Figma**, and **Lovable**, I helped students elevate their pitches and communicate their ideas more convincingly.\n\n## IMD (Innovation Week for Company Teams)\n\nLater in the year, I collaborated with **IMD company teams** during their Innovation Week. This was a faster-paced, business-driven environment where I supported participants in:\n\n- Designing **functional app prototypes**\n- Translating **strategic concepts into interactive experiences**\n- Improving the **clarity and impact** of presentations\n\nHere, the emphasis was on turning innovation challenges into **practical digital prototypes**, equipping teams with tools they could showcase to stakeholders.\n\n## Impact\n\nAcross both programs, my role blended **design coaching, product thinking, and rapid prototyping**. Teams consistently walked away with:\n\n- Clearer **value propositions** and positioning\n- Stronger **visual storytelling** in pitch decks\n- Tangible **app prototypes** to support their ideas\n\nThese coaching experiences allowed me to contribute to the growth of future innovators, while also refining my own ability to **move quickly from concept to execution**.\n",
