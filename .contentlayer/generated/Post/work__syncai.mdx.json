SyncAI was our answer to this gap — a startup focused on creating accessible, practical AI-powered software for SMEs.\n\n## Building the Company\n\nFrom the beginning, SyncAI was more than a software project — it was a startup. That meant thinking not just about code, but also about markets, users, and strategy. With no external funding, every decision was a trade-off between ambition and pragmatism.\n\nMy role combined both **technical execution** and **entrepreneurial responsibility**:\n\n- I designed and developed the user-facing side of our products.\n- I worked as a co-founder to shape the company strategy, validate assumptions, and push the team toward tangible outcomes.\n\nBuilding SyncAI taught me how to:\n\n- Define a **minimum viable product** under tight constraints.\n- Validate ideas directly with merchants through interviews and feedback.\n- Balance different co-founder perspectives while keeping alignment on vision.\n- Navigate the uncertainty and pressure of an early-stage startup.\n\n## Products\n\nDuring my time at SyncAI, we initiated two product lines that embodied our mission of making AI useful and affordable for SMEs:\n\n- **Athena**: a SaaS platform for e-commerce price optimization, built during an intensive summer at the 42 Oléron campus.\n\n<PostCard url=\"/work/athena\" />\n<PostCard url=\"/work/themis\" />\n\n- **Themis**: a tool designed to help SMEs make sense of their internal data (details in the dedicated post).\n\nEach product was an experiment in validating a market hypothesis. Together, they served as proof that AI could be packaged in a way that was both approachable and valuable for small businesses.\n\n## Challenges\n\nSyncAI faced the classic challenges of an early-stage startup:\n\n- Limited resources, requiring us to prioritize ruthlessly.\n- The need to ship quickly while maintaining enough quality to be credible.\n- Aligning three co-founders with different strengths, perspectives, and long-term visions.\n\nThese challenges were as much entrepreneurial as technical, and they shaped my growth as both a developer and a founder.\n\n## Reflection\n\nUltimately, I decided to leave SyncAI when I realized that my long-term vision no longer aligned with the rest of the team. It was a difficult choice, but also one of the most valuable lessons of the journey: **shared vision is as important as execution**.\n\nEven so, SyncAI was a defining chapter for me. I co-founded a company, built real SaaS products from zero, and gained first-hand experience in entrepreneurship, product strategy, and startup dynamics. The lessons I learned at SyncAI continue to guide how I approach both technology and business today.\n",
