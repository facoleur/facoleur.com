Well, now it's not just a possibility - it's a reality, thanks to DEX aggregators!\n\n## Using a DEX Aggregator (DEXag)\n\nDEX aggregators like @paraswap, @1inch, and @matchaxyz are changing the game by providing the best available prices across all DEXs on a chain. This innovation in the cryptocurrency world is not only convenient but also cost-effective.\n\nA DEX aggregator typically goes a step further by splitting transactions across multiple DEXs and pools. This approach optimizes each pool's liquidity and results in more advantageous transactions than if they were executed on a single DEX or pool.\n\n## Real-world Examples\n\nFor instance, to swap 10k ARB for DAI, Paraswap first swaps to USDC on @traderjoe_xyz, then to DAI on UniswapV3. However, for a larger amount like 100k ARB, it's more beneficial to split the trade across several routes to avoid unbalancing a single pool and experiencing slippage.\n\nSo, how does one choose the right DEX aggregator? Thanks to @DefiLlama, you don't have to worry anymore! DeFiLlama Swap is a meta-aggregator that connects to all DEX aggregators to offer you the best of the best prices.\n\nFor 10k ARB, the best price seems to be on @KyberNetwork, whereas for 100k ARB, Firebird offers a more favorable rate. In this scenario, DeFiLlama Swap outperforms Paraswap in terms of pricing.\n\nIf you're not yet familiar with @DefiLlama's new tool, I highly recommend using it for all your swaps. It's set to save you even more than standard DEX aggregators.\n\nTool link: [Defillama swap](https://swap.defillama.com/)\n",

          "raw": "\n## The project\n\nAlpes Vivantes is a Swiss non-profit association dedicated to the preservation and education of biodiversity in the Alps. They approached me to design and develop a comprehensive web platform that would serve both as a public-facing website and an internal content management system (CMS) for their members.\n\n![Alpes Vivantes logo](/assets/alpesvivantes/av_1.jpg)\n\nThe platform needed to support a wide range of features, including the ability to publish events and manage subscriptions, sell local products, accept donations, and oversee different types of content such as publications, partners, and committee members.\n\n## The process\n\n- Held several meetings with the client to understand their needs, their users, and their overall goals.\n- Used these discussions to explain the possibilities and limitations of the web, and to align expectations with the available budget and time constraints.\n- Created wireframes and a design board to help the client choose a design direction, ensuring that the visual identity matched both the client's vision and the association's mission.\n- Developed the website using WordPress and Elementor, combined with a significant amount of **custom PHP**. Due to the project's complexity and tight deadlines, I often had to _vibecode_, experimenting and iterating quickly to reach solutions despite my limited PHP knowledge at the time.\n\n## The challenges\n\nThe project presented several challenges. First, I had to coordinate the input of association members, who each had different ideas and priorities for the platform. Balancing these diverse perspectives and finding common ground required patience and clear communication.\n\n![Alpes Vivantes homepage](/assets/alpesvivantes/options.jpg)\n\nAnother major challenge was staying within budget, which was particularly difficult given the complexity of the required features. At the same time, I had to ensure that the CMS was engaging and easy to use. Since content creation was expected to come from the members themselves—most of whom were not technical users—it was crucial to design an intuitive backoffice that encouraged participation.\n\n## Webapp features\n\n- **Custom visual identity** designed to give Alpes Vivantes a coherent and professional online presence.\n- **Custom CMS backoffice** tailored to the association's needs, supporting management of:\n  - Publications (such as news, articles, and project reports)\n  - Products for the shop\n  - Partners\n  - Committee members\n  - Events\n- **Interactive map** displaying ongoing projects, color-coded by type.\n- **Newsletter generator** that allowed the client to select recent publications, provide a title, and automatically generate a formatted newsletter ready for Mailchimp.\n\n## Complex role system\n\nOne of the most demanding parts of the project was the creation of a complex role system with different permissions for each type of user. The association required granular control over what admins, editors, authors, contributors, and visitors could do.\n\n| Permissions                         | Admin | Editor | Author | Contributor | Visitor |\n| ----------------------------------- | :---: | :----: | :----: | :---------: | :-----: |\n| Everything                          |   X   |        |        |             |         |\n| Change user roles                   |   X   |        |        |             |         |\n| Edit static content (text + images) |   X   |   X    |        |             |         |\n| Add committee members               |   X   |   X    |        |             |         |\n| Approve publications                |   X   |   X    |        |             |         |\n| Add partners                        |   X   |   X    |        |             |         |\n| Create products                     |   X   |   X    |   X    |             |         |\n| Publish                             |   X   |   X    |        |             |         |\n| Publish with approval               |       |        |   X    |             |         |\n| Register                            |       |        |        |      X      |    X    |\n\nThis system ensured that:\n\n- **Admins** could manage everything, including roles and permissions.\n- **Editors** had strong content management powers but without administrative control.\n- **Authors** could create products and publish with approval.\n- **Contributors** and **visitors** had minimal rights, restricted mainly to registering or submitting content for validation.\n\n## The result\n\nDespite the constraints, the project delivered a **functional and engaging platform** that combined both a public-facing website and a powerful private backoffice. The custom CMS streamlined workflows for managing:\n\n![Alpes Vivantes](/assets/alpesvivantes/single.jpg)\n![Alpes Vivantes](/assets/alpesvivantes/article.jpg)\n\n- Content of static pages\n- CRUD publications\n- CRUD shop products\n- CRUD partners\n- CRUD events, with subscription management\n- CRUD committee members\n\nThe intuitive design encouraged greater participation from members, who were now able to contribute and publish content with confidence.\n\nIn addition, the new platform gave Alpes Vivantes a **professional and unified digital identity**. The interactive map and newsletter generator added value for both the client and their users, while the complex role system ensured the right balance between flexibility and control.\n\nUltimately, the project not only met the client's goals but also empowered the association to better communicate, collaborate, and share its mission online.\n\n![Alpes Vivantes](/assets/alpesvivantes/features.jpg)\n",

To align with established TypeScript conventions, I implemented a custom Axios instance with interceptors that converted keys to camelCase on the fly, while handling exceptions such as Django's nested filter keys using double underscores.\n\n#### Filtering system and data tables\n\nTo enable efficient search across hundreds of products, I built a flexible filtering system with multiple combinable filters, managed through a [Zustand store](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) and synchronized with the UI. I also developed a reusable filter component that supported number, text, select, multiselect, and boolean filters, automatically adapting its behavior to the filter type.\n\n![Charts](/assets/athena/filters.jpg)\n\nI implemented a full featured datatable with column visibility, pagination and global search. The datatable was integrated with [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to manage loading states and cache data, and to invalidate queries when filters or parameters changed.\n\n#### Charts\n\nI first implemented charts with Plotly but later refactored to [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for better integration with React. I built custom chart components supporting multi line, bar, grouped bar, and scatter charts, with attention to responsiveness and interactivity. Chart data was cached when possible using React Query.\n\n![Charts](/assets/athena/charts.jpg)\n\n#### Authentication and roles\n\nAthena supports customer, admin, and sales roles. The sales role was a custom role with backoffice access to supplier data across marketplaces.\n\n#### Testing\n\nI wrote unit tests for critical components using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), focusing on the filtering system, datatable, and chart components. End to end testing was handled with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) in a separate repository, integrated with CI/CD to run on every push and send notifications to Slack.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nAthena's frontend brought together complex data handling, interactive visualization, and role based access into a single application, making it a reliable tool for managing products and pricing on Swiss marketplaces.\n",

This was a faster-paced, business-driven environment where I supported participants in:\n\n- Designing **functional app prototypes**\n- Translating **strategic concepts into interactive experiences**\n- Improving the **clarity and impact** of presentations\n\nHere, the emphasis was on turning innovation challenges into **practical digital prototypes**, equipping teams with tools they could showcase to stakeholders.\n\n## Impact\n\nAcross both programs, my role blended **design coaching, product thinking, and rapid prototyping**. Teams consistently walked away with:\n\n- Clearer **value propositions** and positioning\n- Stronger **visual storytelling** in pitch decks\n- Tangible **app prototypes** to support their ideas\n\nThese coaching experiences allowed me to contribute to the growth of future innovators, while also refining my own ability to **move quickly from concept to execution**.\n",

        "body": {
          "raw": "\n## The company and product\n\nMiPasa, built by Hacera, is a data analytics platform that enables organizations to securely share, analyze, and automate insights through Python notebooks, a no code visualization canvas, and a simple pipeline builder.\n\nWhen I joined MiPasa, the platform was mainly an online notebook editor with collaboration features, but it was heavily code-first. Non-technical users struggled to manipulate data, features lacked consistency, the product vision was unclear, and the platform needed to grow beyond notebooks into a complete data analytics solution.\n\n## My Contributions\n\nOn the design side, I worked within MiPasa's existing design system and contributed to its evolution. I designed new features and components, moving from user flows all the way to developer handoff. I also improved the design system to make it more consistent and scalable, and collaborated closely with designers and developers to ensure smooth implementation.\n\nOn the data side, I used MiPasa itself to create dashboards and reports on DeFi and crypto data. These dashboards served as concrete examples of how the platform could be used and many of them remain usable today, powered by live data and simulations. This work helped demonstrate the value of MiPasa through real-world applications rather than abstract features.\n\n## Dashboards and Reports\n\nOne of the dashboards I built tracked a stablecoin leverage strategy. The strategy started by depositing sDAI on Aave on Gnosis, benefiting from the high fixed rate on sDAI enabled by Maker's multiple revenue sources. The next step was to borrow DAI, swap it into sDAI, and repeat the loop. At the time, this could be automated with the Contango dApp, which did not charge any fees.\n\n![Stablecoin leverage strategy dashboard](/assets/mipasa/chart.jpg)\nThe above chart shows the performance of the strategy over time, including an average APY (Annual Percentage Yield). The strategy was juicy back then.\n\nThe dashboard displayed the relevant interest rates over time, the accumulated capital if the strategy had been started on a specific date, and key risk metrics such as liquidation price and health factor. It also included alerts to indicate when the strategy was no longer profitable.\n\n## Landing page redesign\n\nAlongside product work, I redesigned MiPasa's public landing page to better communicate the product vision and capabilities. The new design focused on clarity, consistency with the product design system, and a more modern aesthetic to position MiPasa as a professional and trustworthy platform for data analytics.\n\n### Before: issues identified\n\nSome of the specific issues I identified:\n\n- Messaging was dense and unfocused: the value was lost in too much detail.\n- Font styles were inconsistent, and text hierarchy was not handled properly.\n- Visual identity was confusing, with mascots that felt out of place for a data analytics product.\n- The color palette did not align with MiPasa’s brand (dark, grey, white, green) and gradients added unnecessary noise.\n- Critical sections, such as user showcases, lacked authenticity: notebooks were shown as “created by MiPasa” rather than by real people, and profile images were missing.\n- Some content was outdated (ads for past events) or irrelevant (mascots, “big bang” graphics, “inspector” character).\n- Layout decisions such as wide tab sections, icons unrelated to their content, and poorly structured grids made the page feel cluttered.\n\n![Old MiPasa landing page](/assets/mipasa/mipasa_2.jpg)\n\n### After: The redesign\n\nMain improvements I introduced:\n\n- A clear headline and concise value proposition at the top.\n- Simplified typography with only two styles: large bold titles and grey body text for readability.\n- Removal of mascots and unrelated icons in favor of snippets directly from the app.\n- Consistent dark theme with white, grey, and green accents, staying true to MiPasa’s identity.\n- A stronger header section, recapping the platform’s core benefits right away.\n- Authentic user showcases with profile pictures and real notebook authors instead of placeholders.\n- Updated sections to highlight relevant notebooks, focusing on MiPasa’s strengths such as risk management, portfolio optimization, and prediction models.\n- Improved layout with better use of grids, more balanced tab sections, and visual placeholders to emphasize hierarchy.\n- Addition of a partner section to reinforce credibility.\n\n![New MiPasa landing page](/assets/mipasa/mipasa_1.jpg)\n\n## Outcome and Impact\n\nMy design work helped shift MiPasa from a code-first product to a platform accessible to non-technical users. People could manipulate data without writing code, build multi-chart visualizations directly in the interface, and create pipelines through simple UI interactions. By improving and rationalizing the design system, I also contributed to better consistency and scalability across the platform.\n\nThe dashboards and reports I built for DeFi and crypto became important proof points of MiPasa's potential. They showed how the platform could deliver practical insights and demonstrated its capabilities to stakeholders and users.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot show the UI or the dashboards themselves, as the platform is private and I do not have the rights to share them.\n\n## Learnings\n\nI learned how to work within an existing design system while extending it with consistency. I gained experience in making complex technical features approachable and user-friendly. I also learned how to balance usability goals with developer constraints, and how to showcase the value of a product through real-world use cases.\n",

SyncAI was our answer to this gap — a startup focused on creating accessible, practical AI-powered software for SMEs.\n\n## Building the Company\n\nFrom the beginning, SyncAI was more than a software project — it was a startup. That meant thinking not just about code, but also about markets, users, and strategy. With no external funding, every decision was a trade-off between ambition and pragmatism.\n\nMy role combined both **technical execution** and **entrepreneurial responsibility**:\n\n- I designed and developed the user-facing side of our products.\n- I worked as a co-founder to shape the company strategy, validate assumptions, and push the team toward tangible outcomes.\n\nBuilding SyncAI taught me how to:\n\n- Define a **minimum viable product** under tight constraints.\n- Validate ideas directly with merchants through interviews and feedback.\n- Balance different co-founder perspectives while keeping alignment on vision.\n- Navigate the uncertainty and pressure of an early-stage startup.\n\n## Products\n\nDuring my time at SyncAI, we initiated two product lines that embodied our mission of making AI useful and affordable for SMEs:\n\n- **Athena**: a SaaS platform for e-commerce price optimization, built during an intensive summer at the 42 Oléron campus.\n\n<PostCard url=\"/work/athena\" />\n<PostCard url=\"/work/themis\" />\n\n- **Themis**: a tool designed to help SMEs make sense of their internal data (details in the dedicated post).\n\nEach product was an experiment in validating a market hypothesis. Together, they served as proof that AI could be packaged in a way that was both approachable and valuable for small businesses.\n\n## Challenges\n\nSyncAI faced the classic challenges of an early-stage startup:\n\n- Limited resources, requiring us to prioritize ruthlessly.\n- The need to ship quickly while maintaining enough quality to be credible.\n- Aligning three co-founders with different strengths, perspectives, and long-term visions.\n\nThese challenges were as much entrepreneurial as technical, and they shaped my growth as both a developer and a founder.\n\n## Reflection\n\nUltimately, I decided to leave SyncAI when I realized that my long-term vision no longer aligned with the rest of the team. It was a difficult choice, but also one of the most valuable lessons of the journey: **shared vision is as important as execution**.\n\nEven so, SyncAI was a defining chapter for me. I co-founded a company, built real SaaS products from zero, and gained first-hand experience in entrepreneurship, product strategy, and startup dynamics. The lessons I learned at SyncAI continue to guide how I approach both technology and business today.\n",
