Well, now it's not just a possibility - it's a reality, thanks to DEX aggregators!\n\n## Using a DEX Aggregator (DEXag)\n\nDEX aggregators like @paraswap, @1inch, and @matchaxyz are changing the game by providing the best available prices across all DEXs on a chain. This innovation in the cryptocurrency world is not only convenient but also cost-effective.\n\nA DEX aggregator typically goes a step further by splitting transactions across multiple DEXs and pools. This approach optimizes each pool's liquidity and results in more advantageous transactions than if they were executed on a single DEX or pool.\n\n## Real-world Examples\n\nFor instance, to swap 10k ARB for DAI, Paraswap first swaps to USDC on @traderjoe_xyz, then to DAI on UniswapV3. However, for a larger amount like 100k ARB, it's more beneficial to split the trade across several routes to avoid unbalancing a single pool and experiencing slippage.\n\nSo, how does one choose the right DEX aggregator? Thanks to @DefiLlama, you don't have to worry anymore! DeFiLlama Swap is a meta-aggregator that connects to all DEX aggregators to offer you the best of the best prices.\n\nFor 10k ARB, the best price seems to be on @KyberNetwork, whereas for 100k ARB, Firebird offers a more favorable rate. In this scenario, DeFiLlama Swap outperforms Paraswap in terms of pricing.\n\nIf you're not yet familiar with @DefiLlama's new tool, I highly recommend using it for all your swaps. It's set to save you even more than standard DEX aggregators.\n\nTool link: [Defillama swap](https://swap.defillama.com/)\n",

          "raw": "\n# Alpes Vivantes – Big Webapp Project\n\n# Alpes Vivantes – Big Webapp Project\n\n## The Process\n\n- Held several meetings with the client to understand their needs, their users, and their overall goals.\n- Used these discussions to explain the possibilities and limitations of the web, and to align expectations with the available budget and time constraints.\n- Created wireframes and a design board to help the client choose a design direction, ensuring that the visual identity matched both the client’s vision and the association’s mission.\n- Developed the website using **WordPress** and **Elementor**, combined with a significant amount of **custom PHP**. Due to the project’s complexity and tight deadlines, I often had to “vibecode,” experimenting and iterating quickly to reach solutions despite my limited PHP knowledge at the time.\n\n---\n\n## The Features\n\n- **Custom visual identity** designed to give Alpes Vivantes a coherent and professional online presence.\n- **Custom CMS backoffice** tailored to the association’s needs, supporting management of:\n  - Publications (such as news, articles, and project reports)\n  - Products for the shop\n  - Partners\n  - Committee members\n  - Events\n- **Interactive map** displaying ongoing projects, color-coded by type.\n- **Newsletter generator** that allowed the client to select recent publications, provide a title, and automatically generate a formatted newsletter ready for Mailchimp.\n\n## Complex Role System\n\nOne of the most demanding parts of the project was the creation of a complex role system with different permissions for each type of user. The association required granular control over what admins, editors, authors, contributors, and visitors could do.\n\n| Permissions                         | Admin | Editor | Author | Contributor | Visitor |\n| ----------------------------------- | :---: | :----: | :----: | :---------: | :-----: |\n| Everything                          |   X   |        |        |             |         |\n| Change user roles                   |   X   |        |        |             |         |\n| Edit static content (text + images) |   X   |   X    |        |             |         |\n| Add committee members               |   X   |   X    |        |             |         |\n| Approve publications                |   X   |   X    |        |             |         |\n| Add partners                        |   X   |   X    |        |             |         |\n| Create products                     |   X   |   X    |   X    |             |         |\n| Publish                             |   X   |   X    |        |             |         |\n| Publish with approval               |       |        |   X    |             |         |\n| Register                            |       |        |        |      X      |    X    |\n\nThis system ensured that:\n\n- **Admins** could manage everything, including roles and permissions.\n- **Editors** had strong content management powers but without administrative control.\n- **Authors** could create products and publish with approval.\n- **Contributors** and **visitors** had minimal rights, restricted mainly to registering or submitting content for validation.\n\n## The Challenges\n\nThe project presented several challenges. First, I had to coordinate the input of association members, who each had different ideas and priorities for the platform. Balancing these diverse perspectives and finding common ground required patience and clear communication.\n\nAnother major challenge was staying within budget, which was particularly difficult given the complexity of the required features. At the same time, I had to ensure that the CMS was engaging and easy to use. Since content creation was expected to come from the members themselves—most of whom were not technical users—it was crucial to design an intuitive backoffice that encouraged participation.\n\n## The Result\n\nDespite the constraints, the project delivered a **functional and engaging platform** that combined both a public-facing website and a powerful private backoffice. The custom CMS streamlined workflows for managing:\n\n- Content of static pages\n- CRUD publications\n- CRUD shop products\n- CRUD partners\n- CRUD events, with subscription management\n- CRUD committee members\n\nThe intuitive design encouraged greater participation from members, who were now able to contribute and publish content with confidence.\n\nIn addition, the new platform gave Alpes Vivantes a **professional and unified digital identity**. The interactive map and newsletter generator added value for both the client and their users, while the complex role system ensured the right balance between flexibility and control.\n\nUltimately, the project not only met the client's goals but also empowered the association to better communicate, collaborate, and share its mission online.\n",

The stack includes Tailwind CSS for styling, Axios with a custom fetcher, React Query for data fetching and caching, Recharts for charts, TanStack Table for datatables, Radix UI for components, and Zustand for state management.\n\n![Charts](/assets/athena/single.jpg)\n\n## Technical details\n\n#### Backend integration\n\nThe backend was built with Django, which returned snake_case keys. To align with established TypeScript conventions, I implemented a custom Axios instance with interceptors that converted keys to camelCase on the fly, while handling exceptions such as Django's nested filter keys using double underscores.\n\n#### Filtering system and data tables\n\nTo enable efficient search across hundreds of products, I built a flexible filtering system with multiple combinable filters, managed through a [Zustand store](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) and synchronized with the UI. I also developed a reusable filter component that supported number, text, select, multiselect, and boolean filters, automatically adapting its behavior to the filter type.\n\n![Charts](/assets/athena/filters.jpg)\n\nI implemented a full featured datatable with column visibility, pagination and global search. The datatable was integrated with [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to manage loading states and cache data, and to invalidate queries when filters or parameters changed.\n\n#### Charts\n\nI first implemented charts with Plotly but later refactored to [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for better integration with React. I built custom chart components supporting multi line, bar, grouped bar, and scatter charts, with attention to responsiveness and interactivity. Chart data was cached when possible using React Query.\n\n![Charts](/assets/athena/charts.jpg)\n\n#### Authentication and roles\n\nAthena supports customer, admin, and sales roles. The sales role was a custom role with backoffice access to supplier data across marketplaces.\n\n#### Testing\n\nI wrote unit tests for critical components using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), focusing on the filtering system, datatable, and chart components. End to end testing was handled with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) in a separate repository, integrated with CI/CD to run on every push and send notifications to Slack.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nAthena's frontend brought together complex data handling, interactive visualization, and role based access into a single application, making it a reliable tool for managing products and pricing on Swiss marketplaces.\n",

Teams consistently walked away with:\n\n- Clearer **value propositions** and positioning\n- Stronger **visual storytelling** in pitch decks\n- Tangible **app prototypes** to support their ideas\n\nThese coaching experiences allowed me to contribute to the growth of future innovators, while also refining my own ability to **move quickly from concept to execution**.\n",

        "body": {
          "raw": "\n## The company and product\n\nMiPasa, built by Hacera, is a data analytics platform that enables organizations to securely share, analyze, and automate insights through Python notebooks, a no code visualization canvas, and a simple pipeline builder.\n\nWhen I joined MiPasa, the platform was mainly an online notebook editor with collaboration features, but it was heavily code-first. Non-technical users struggled to manipulate data, features lacked consistency, the product vision was unclear, and the platform needed to grow beyond notebooks into a complete data analytics solution.\n\n## My Contributions\n\nOn the design side, I worked within MiPasa's existing design system and contributed to its evolution. I designed new features and components, moving from user flows all the way to developer handoff. I also improved the design system to make it more consistent and scalable, and collaborated closely with designers and developers to ensure smooth implementation.\n\nOn the data side, I used MiPasa itself to create dashboards and reports on DeFi and crypto data. These dashboards served as concrete examples of how the platform could be used and many of them remain usable today, powered by live data and simulations. This work helped demonstrate the value of MiPasa through real-world applications rather than abstract features.\n\n## Dashboards and Reports\n\nOne of the dashboards I built tracked a stablecoin leverage strategy. The strategy started by depositing sDAI on Aave on Gnosis, benefiting from the high fixed rate on sDAI enabled by Maker's multiple revenue sources. The next step was to borrow DAI, swap it into sDAI, and repeat the loop. At the time, this could be automated with the Contango dApp, which did not charge any fees.\n\n![Stablecoin leverage strategy dashboard](/assets/mipasa/chart.jpg)\nThe above chart shows the performance of the strategy over time, including an average APY (Annual Percentage Yield). The strategy was juicy back then.\n\nThe dashboard displayed the relevant interest rates over time, the accumulated capital if the strategy had been started on a specific date, and key risk metrics such as liquidation price and health factor. It also included alerts to indicate when the strategy was no longer profitable.\n\n## Landing page redesign\n\nAlongside product work, I redesigned MiPasa's public landing page to better communicate the product vision and capabilities. The new design focused on clarity, consistency with the product design system, and a more modern aesthetic to position MiPasa as a professional and trustworthy platform for data analytics.\n\n### Before: issues identified\n\nSome of the specific issues I identified:\n\n- Messaging was dense and unfocused: the value was lost in too much detail.\n- Font styles were inconsistent, and text hierarchy was not handled properly.\n- Visual identity was confusing, with mascots that felt out of place for a data analytics product.\n- The color palette did not align with MiPasa’s brand (dark, grey, white, green) and gradients added unnecessary noise.\n- Critical sections, such as user showcases, lacked authenticity: notebooks were shown as “created by MiPasa” rather than by real people, and profile images were missing.\n- Some content was outdated (ads for past events) or irrelevant (mascots, “big bang” graphics, “inspector” character).\n- Layout decisions such as wide tab sections, icons unrelated to their content, and poorly structured grids made the page feel cluttered.\n\n![Old MiPasa landing page](/assets/mipasa/mipasa_2.jpg)\n\n### After: The redesign\n\nMain improvements I introduced:\n\n- A clear headline and concise value proposition at the top.\n- Simplified typography with only two styles: large bold titles and grey body text for readability.\n- Removal of mascots and unrelated icons in favor of snippets directly from the app.\n- Consistent dark theme with white, grey, and green accents, staying true to MiPasa’s identity.\n- A stronger header section, recapping the platform’s core benefits right away.\n- Authentic user showcases with profile pictures and real notebook authors instead of placeholders.\n- Updated sections to highlight relevant notebooks, focusing on MiPasa’s strengths such as risk management, portfolio optimization, and prediction models.\n- Improved layout with better use of grids, more balanced tab sections, and visual placeholders to emphasize hierarchy.\n- Addition of a partner section to reinforce credibility.\n\n![New MiPasa landing page](/assets/mipasa/mipasa_1.jpg)\n\n## Outcome and Impact\n\nMy design work helped shift MiPasa from a code-first product to a platform accessible to non-technical users. People could manipulate data without writing code, build multi-chart visualizations directly in the interface, and create pipelines through simple UI interactions. By improving and rationalizing the design system, I also contributed to better consistency and scalability across the platform.\n\nThe dashboards and reports I built for DeFi and crypto became important proof points of MiPasa's potential. They showed how the platform could deliver practical insights and demonstrated its capabilities to stakeholders and users.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot show the UI or the dashboards themselves, as the platform is private and I do not have the rights to share them.\n\n## Learnings\n\nI learned how to work within an existing design system while extending it with consistency. I gained experience in making complex technical features approachable and user-friendly. I also learned how to balance usability goals with developer constraints, and how to showcase the value of a product through real-world use cases.\n",

          "raw": "\nIn 2023 I co-founded SyncAI to help Swiss SMEs access AI tools. Over one summer at the 42 Oléron campus, we built Athena, a SaaS platform for e-commerce price optimization. It was my first real step into entrepreneurship, combining design, development, and company building.\n\n![SyncAI Logo](/assets/syncai/syncai.jpg)\n\n## Project Overview\n\nIn 2023 I co-founded SyncAI SA with Lucas Nicollier and Christian Degouy, the CEO of Bugnard SA.\nWe shared a conviction that artificial intelligence would transform business, but that small and medium enterprises in Switzerland would be left behind if no one built tools tailored for them.\n\nDuring the summer of 2024, Lucas and I spent two months at the 42 Oléron campus, an environment designed for focus and collaboration. There we developed Athena, SyncAI's first product: a SaaS platform that helps Swiss e-commerce merchants optimize their prices on local marketplaces.\n\nMy role combined both **technical execution** and **entrepreneurial responsibility**. I designed and developed the user-facing side of the product, while also working as a co-founder to shape the strategy, make trade-offs, and push the team toward a tangible outcome.\n\n## The Entrepreneurial Journey\n\nSyncAI was not just a software project, it was a startup. This meant that beyond writing code and designing interfaces, I had to think constantly about markets, users, and resources. We had limited time and no outside funding, so every decision was a balance between ambition and pragmatism.\n\nI learned how to define a **minimum viable product** under tight constraints, deciding which features truly mattered for launch and which had to be postponed. I also contributed to market analysis, speaking with potential merchants and validating our assumptions about pricing challenges. These conversations directly influenced the product design — our focus on clarity and simplicity came from hearing how little time business owners had to engage with complex software.\n\nAnother entrepreneurial lesson came from working in a founding team. Each of us had different strengths: Lucas was focused on backend and algorithms, Christian on business vision and strategy, and I bridged design, frontend, and product. This division of roles worked, but it also highlighted how important **alignment of vision** is in a startup. Later, when I realized my long-term vision diverged from the team, I made the difficult choice to leave the company.\n\n## The Product: Athena\n\nAthena was built around three pillars:\n\n- A data scraper that collected real-time product and competitor pricing from Swiss marketplaces such as Galaxus and Ricardo (assumption).\n- A repricing algorithm that dynamically adjusted merchants' prices to stay competitive while maintaining profitability.\n- A merchant dashboard, the component I focused on, which allowed users to monitor their prices, review performance analytics, and configure their repricing strategy.\n\nFrom an entrepreneurial standpoint, Athena was our attempt to prove a market hypothesis: that SMEs would adopt an AI-powered tool if it was simple, affordable, and directly tied to business value.\n\n## Challenges\n\nBuilding Athena in just two months required difficult choices. We faced technical hurdles with scraping Swiss marketplaces, which often use anti-bot protections. To address this, we set up proxy rotation and scheduling mechanisms (assumption).\n\nOn the entrepreneurial side, the challenge was even larger: how do you turn a concept into a usable product in such a short time with no budget? We had to be resourceful, leverage the campus environment for focus, and constantly adjust scope. Every feature required us to ask not just \"can we build it?\" but \"does it create enough value for the user to justify the effort?\"\n\n## Learnings\n\nFrom the technical perspective, I deepened my skills in frontend development and integration with custom APIs, and I learned to design user interfaces for non-technical audiences.\n\nFrom the entrepreneurial perspective, I experienced what it means to **co-found a startup from scratch**. I learned:\n\n- How to validate an idea quickly with real users\n- How to prioritize features in an MVP\n- How to balance different co-founder perspectives\n- How to work under uncertainty and limited resources\n\n## Reflection\n\nAfter the launch of Athena, I decided to leave SyncAI due to a misalignment of vision with the rest of the team. This decision was not easy, but it reinforced one of the most important entrepreneurial lessons: shared vision is as important as technical execution.\n\nSyncAI was a defining experience. I co-founded a company, built a SaaS product from zero, and navigated the complexities of both business and technology. I came out of it with sharper technical skills, a stronger entrepreneurial mindset, and a clearer understanding of what kind of projects I want to pursue in the future.\n",
