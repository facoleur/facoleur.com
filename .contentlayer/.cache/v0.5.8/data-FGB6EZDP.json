Well, now it's not just a possibility - it's a reality, thanks to DEX aggregators!\n\n## Using a DEX Aggregator (DEXag)\n\nDEX aggregators like @paraswap, @1inch, and @matchaxyz are changing the game by providing the best available prices across all DEXs on a chain. This innovation in the cryptocurrency world is not only convenient but also cost-effective.\n\nA DEX aggregator typically goes a step further by splitting transactions across multiple DEXs and pools. This approach optimizes each pool's liquidity and results in more advantageous transactions than if they were executed on a single DEX or pool.\n\n## Real-world Examples\n\nFor instance, to swap 10k ARB for DAI, Paraswap first swaps to USDC on @traderjoe_xyz, then to DAI on UniswapV3. However, for a larger amount like 100k ARB, it's more beneficial to split the trade across several routes to avoid unbalancing a single pool and experiencing slippage.\n\nSo, how does one choose the right DEX aggregator? Thanks to @DefiLlama, you don't have to worry anymore! DeFiLlama Swap is a meta-aggregator that connects to all DEX aggregators to offer you the best of the best prices.\n\nFor 10k ARB, the best price seems to be on @KyberNetwork, whereas for 100k ARB, Firebird offers a more favorable rate. In this scenario, DeFiLlama Swap outperforms Paraswap in terms of pricing.\n\nIf you're not yet familiar with @DefiLlama's new tool, I highly recommend using it for all your swaps. It's set to save you even more than standard DEX aggregators.\n\nTool link: [Defillama swap](https://swap.defillama.com/)\n",

          "raw": "\nIn 2023 I co-founded SyncAI to help Swiss SMEs access AI tools. Over one summer at the 42 Oléron campus, we built Athena, a SaaS platform for e-commerce price optimization. It was my first real step into entrepreneurship, combining design, development, and company building.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nIn 2023 I co-founded SyncAI SA with Lucas Nicollier and Christian Degouy, the CEO of Bugnard SA.\nWe shared a conviction that artificial intelligence would transform business, but that small and medium enterprises in Switzerland would be left behind if no one built tools tailored for them.\n\nDuring the summer of 2024, Lucas and I spent two months at the 42 Oléron campus, an environment designed for focus and collaboration. There we developed Athena, SyncAI's first product: a SaaS platform that helps Swiss e-commerce merchants optimize their prices on local marketplaces.\n\nMy role combined both **technical execution** and **entrepreneurial responsibility**. I designed and developed the user-facing side of the product, while also working as a co-founder to shape the strategy, make trade-offs, and push the team toward a tangible outcome.\n\n## The Entrepreneurial Journey\n\nSyncAI was not just a software project, it was a startup. This meant that beyond writing code and designing interfaces, I had to think constantly about markets, users, and resources. We had limited time and no outside funding, so every decision was a balance between ambition and pragmatism.\n\nI learned how to define a **minimum viable product** under tight constraints, deciding which features truly mattered for launch and which had to be postponed. I also contributed to market analysis, speaking with potential merchants and validating our assumptions about pricing challenges. These conversations directly influenced the product design — our focus on clarity and simplicity came from hearing how little time business owners had to engage with complex software.\n\nAnother entrepreneurial lesson came from working in a founding team. Each of us had different strengths: Lucas was focused on backend and algorithms, Christian on business vision and strategy, and I bridged design, frontend, and product. This division of roles worked, but it also highlighted how important **alignment of vision** is in a startup. Later, when I realized my long-term vision diverged from the team, I made the difficult choice to leave the company.\n\n## The Product: Athena\n\nAthena was built around three pillars:\n\n- A data scraper that collected real-time product and competitor pricing from Swiss marketplaces such as Galaxus and Ricardo (assumption).\n- A repricing algorithm that dynamically adjusted merchants' prices to stay competitive while maintaining profitability.\n- A merchant dashboard, the component I focused on, which allowed users to monitor their prices, review performance analytics, and configure their repricing strategy.\n\nFrom an entrepreneurial standpoint, Athena was our attempt to prove a market hypothesis: that SMEs would adopt an AI-powered tool if it was simple, affordable, and directly tied to business value.\n\n## Challenges\n\nBuilding Athena in just two months required difficult choices. We faced technical hurdles with scraping Swiss marketplaces, which often use anti-bot protections. To address this, we set up proxy rotation and scheduling mechanisms (assumption).\n\nOn the entrepreneurial side, the challenge was even larger: how do you turn a concept into a usable product in such a short time with no budget? We had to be resourceful, leverage the campus environment for focus, and constantly adjust scope. Every feature required us to ask not just \"can we build it?\" but \"does it create enough value for the user to justify the effort?\"\n\n## Learnings\n\nFrom the technical perspective, I deepened my skills in frontend development and integration with custom APIs, and I learned to design user interfaces for non-technical audiences.\n\nFrom the entrepreneurial perspective, I experienced what it means to **co-found a startup from scratch**. I learned:\n\n- How to validate an idea quickly with real users\n- How to prioritize features in an MVP\n- How to balance different co-founder perspectives\n- How to work under uncertainty and limited resources\n\n## Reflection\n\nAfter the launch of Athena, I decided to leave SyncAI due to a misalignment of vision with the rest of the team. This decision was not easy, but it reinforced one of the most important entrepreneurial lessons: shared vision is as important as technical execution.\n\nSyncAI was a defining experience. I co-founded a company, built a SaaS product from zero, and navigated the complexities of both business and technology. I came out of it with sharper technical skills, a stronger entrepreneurial mindset, and a clearer understanding of what kind of projects I want to pursue in the future.\n",
