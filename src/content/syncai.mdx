In 2023 I co-founded SyncAI to help Swiss SMEs access AI tools. Over one summer at the 42 Oléron campus, we built Athena, a SaaS platform for e-commerce price optimization. It was my first real step into entrepreneurship, combining design, development, and company building.

## Project Overview

In 2023 I co-founded SyncAI SA with Lucas Nicollier and Christian Degouy, the CEO of Bugnard SA.
We shared a conviction that artificial intelligence would transform business, but that small and medium enterprises in Switzerland would be left behind if no one built tools tailored for them.

During the summer of 2024, Lucas and I spent two months at the 42 Oléron campus, an environment designed for focus and collaboration. There we developed Athena, SyncAI's first product: a SaaS platform that helps Swiss e-commerce merchants optimize their prices on local marketplaces.

My role combined both **technical execution** and **entrepreneurial responsibility**. I designed and developed the user-facing side of the product, while also working as a co-founder to shape the strategy, make trade-offs, and push the team toward a tangible outcome.

## The Entrepreneurial Journey

SyncAI was not just a software project, it was a startup. This meant that beyond writing code and designing interfaces, I had to think constantly about markets, users, and resources. We had limited time and no outside funding, so every decision was a balance between ambition and pragmatism.

I learned how to define a **minimum viable product** under tight constraints, deciding which features truly mattered for launch and which had to be postponed. I also contributed to market analysis, speaking with potential merchants and validating our assumptions about pricing challenges. These conversations directly influenced the product design — our focus on clarity and simplicity came from hearing how little time business owners had to engage with complex software.

Another entrepreneurial lesson came from working in a founding team. Each of us had different strengths: Lucas was focused on backend and algorithms, Christian on business vision and strategy, and I bridged design, frontend, and product. This division of roles worked, but it also highlighted how important **alignment of vision** is in a startup. Later, when I realized my long-term vision diverged from the team, I made the difficult choice to leave the company.

## The Product: Athena

Athena was built around three pillars:

- A data scraper that collected real-time product and competitor pricing from Swiss marketplaces such as Galaxus and Ricardo (assumption).
- A repricing algorithm that dynamically adjusted merchants' prices to stay competitive while maintaining profitability.
- A merchant dashboard, the component I focused on, which allowed users to monitor their prices, review performance analytics, and configure their repricing strategy.

From an entrepreneurial standpoint, Athena was our attempt to prove a market hypothesis: that SMEs would adopt an AI-powered tool if it was simple, affordable, and directly tied to business value.

## Challenges

Building Athena in just two months required difficult choices. We faced technical hurdles with scraping Swiss marketplaces, which often use anti-bot protections. To address this, we set up proxy rotation and scheduling mechanisms (assumption).

On the entrepreneurial side, the challenge was even larger: how do you turn a concept into a usable product in such a short time with no budget? We had to be resourceful, leverage the campus environment for focus, and constantly adjust scope. Every feature required us to ask not just "can we build it?" but "does it create enough value for the user to justify the effort?"

## Learnings

From the technical perspective, I deepened my skills in frontend development and integration with custom APIs, and I learned to design user interfaces for non-technical audiences.

From the entrepreneurial perspective, I experienced what it means to **co-found a startup from scratch**. I learned:

- How to validate an idea quickly with real users
- How to prioritize features in an MVP
- How to balance different co-founder perspectives
- How to work under uncertainty and limited resources

## Reflection

After the launch of Athena, I decided to leave SyncAI due to a misalignment of vision with the rest of the team. This decision was not easy, but it reinforced one of the most important entrepreneurial lessons: shared vision is as important as technical execution.

SyncAI was a defining experience. I co-founded a company, built a SaaS product from zero, and navigated the complexities of both business and technology. I came out of it with sharper technical skills, a stronger entrepreneurial mindset, and a clearer understanding of what kind of projects I want to pursue in the future.
