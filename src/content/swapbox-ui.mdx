## The project

For swapbox, the evidence is clear: it is impossible to acquire crypto without going through the traditional financial system. This goes against the fundamental values of crypto-currencies.

Swapbox offers a solution for acquiring crypto currencies without an account or bank card, and without going through centralised trading platforms.

Swapbox is a crypto ATM that does not need to be connected to a centralized exchange. Instead, it uses a smart contract and a stablecoin reserve to perform trades directly on-chain on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.

## The challenge

Swapbox needed a friendly user interface for their machines, that was possible to implement with it's technical constraints, for both Swapbox operators and end users.

I took in charge the whole UX and UI design process of the swapbox machine GUI, from defining users needs to prototyping a final product, ready for developers hand-off.
