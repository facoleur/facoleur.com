## Context

Company: MiPasa
Industry: Financial, Blockchain, Risk Management
Role: Freelance Product Designer (1+ year)
Scope: End-to-end design - from user flows to dev handoff, feature design, and design system improvements.

## The Challenge

When I joined MiPasa, the platform was an online notebook editor with collaboration features, but it was heavily code-first:

- Non-technical users struggled to manipulate data.
- Features lacked style consistency.
- The product needed to grow beyond a notebook into a full data analytics platform.

## My Contributions

- Learned and worked within MiPasa's existing design system.
- Designed new features and components (from user flow to final dev handoff).
- Rationalized and improved the design system, ensuring consistency and scalability.
- Collaborated closely with developers for seamless implementation.

## Process

1. User Flows - mapped how users could manipulate data, build pipelines, and visualize insights.
2. Wireframes and Iterations - explored different interaction models for complex data tasks.
3. UI Design - expanded the design system while maintaining visual consistency.
4. Collaboration - continuous feedback loops with developers to balance usability with technical feasibility.

(Add visuals: user flows, wireframes, UI mockups, design system snippets)

## Outcome and Impact

- Shifted MiPasa from code-first to a no-code accessible platform.
- Enabled users to:
  - Manipulate data without writing code.
  - Build complex multi-charts visually.
  - Create data pipelines through UI interactions.
- Improved design consistency and scalability via an updated design system.
- Had a real impact on product usability and adoption.

## Learnings

- How to adapt to an existing design system and expand it with consistency.
- Designing complex technical features in a user-friendly way.
- Navigating the trade-offs between developer constraints and usability.

## Visuals (to add)

- Before vs. After screenshots.
- User flow diagrams.
- Examples of redesigned components.
- Dashboards, pipeline builder UI, or chart creation screens.
