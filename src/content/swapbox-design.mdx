Swapbox is a crypto ATM that does not need to be connected to a centralized exchange. Instead, it uses a smart contract and a stablecoin reserve to perform trades directly on-chain on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.

### Building a design system that scale on all types of devices

The challenge of designing UI and UX for Swapbox is that has apps on all types of devices: Desktop, mobile and the machine 7" screen. I built the design system with those constraint in mind.
