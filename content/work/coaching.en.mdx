In early 2025, I began working with Inartis as a coach during Cezar Ritz’s Innovation Week. Later, in the mid-to-late 2025, I was invited to coach at IMD’s Innovation Week, supporting company teams on more advanced challenges.

## Inartis (Cezar Ritz Colleges Innovation Week)

At Inartis, I coached students as they transformed initial ideas into structured business concepts. My contributions included:

- Refining ideas, products, and positioning
- Designing visuals, pitch decks, and storytelling
- Prototyping early apps and digital solutions to bring ideas to life

I typically worked with 3–4 teams per day, guiding them through short cycles of feedback and rapid iteration. Using Canva, Figma, and Lovable, I helped students elevate their pitches and communicate their ideas more convincingly.

## IMD (Innovation Week for Company Teams)

Later in the year, I collaborated with IMD company teams during their Innovation Week. This was a faster-paced, business-driven environment where I supported participants in:

- Designing functional app prototypes
- Translating strategic concepts into interactive experiences
- Improving the clarity and impact of presentations

Here, the emphasis was on turning innovation challenges into practical digital prototypes, equipping teams with tools they could showcase to stakeholders.

## Impact

Across both programs, my role blended design coaching, product thinking, and rapid prototyping. Teams consistently walked away with:

- Clearer value propositions and positioning
- Stronger visual storytelling in pitch decks
- Tangible app prototypes to support their ideas

These coaching experiences allowed me to contribute to the growth of future innovators, while also refining my own ability to move quickly from concept to execution.
