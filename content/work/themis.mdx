## Themis – Legal Research SaaS

[Themis](https://www.themis.legal/en) is a Swiss legal research assistant that streamlines access to legal texts, multilingual information, AI-driven summaries, and judgment analysis.

### Role & Responsibilities

As part of the founding team, I led the **design**, **development**, and **marketing** efforts, and architected the full **user management** and automation infrastructure.

- Designed the brand's **visual identity** and crafted all marketing assets. Developed the landing page with clear messaging (“Legal research: stop wasting time, gain precision”) and feature highlights such as AI summaries, instant translation, multilingual search, and contextualized source access.
- Integrated **PostHog** for detailed analytics on user behavior and campaign performance.
- Built landing page–linked **LinkedIn marketing campaigns** to drive conversions and trial sign-ups.
- Set up **Google Firebase** and **Firestore** for user authentication, data storage, and roles.
- Developed comprehensive **Firebase Cloud Functions** to automate workflows: transactional emails, user roles, subscription flows with **Stripe**, marketing emails, in-app notifications, and free-trial logic.
- Orchestrated **subscription plans**: Free vs. Pro vs. Enterprise; Pro includes AI Assistant, unlimited source access, priority support; offered a 7-day free trial with no credit card required.
- Handled **campaign tracking**, user acquisition, and churn analysis using analytics tools linked to Firebase and the site analytics.

### What I Learned

Launching a SaaS product challenged me to grow across disciplines — from design and marketing to backend systems and subscription logic. I acquired hands-on expertise in product design, full-stack implementation, analytics, and growth strategies.
