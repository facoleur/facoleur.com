Swapbox is a crypto ATM that does not need to be connected to a centralized exchange. Instead, it uses a smart contract and a stablecoin reserve to perform trades directly on-chain on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.

## Admin decentralized dApp: the core value of Swapbox

The admin dApp is used by Swapbox operators to control their fleet. It is an essential component of Swapbox; used to deploy a Swapbox smart contract, choose a stablecoin used as liquidity, configure the fee rates, link and unlink machines, set transaction limits, explore detailed analytics, etc.

### Understanding user needs and flows

The Swapbox admin dApp is a complex platform that serves as the primary interface for Swapbox operators. The Swapbox team and I first had to brainstorm what functionalities are needed for the app and how to make them easy to use, as well as considering the limitation brought by the Web3 nature of Swapbox.

Swapbox dApp is a complex system composed of 3 main components:

### 1. Contract deploylement

Deploy and configure a Swapbox contract. The configuration is structured in 3 parts:

1. AMM selection
2. Stablecoin selection
3. Contract information (name)

### 2. Contract and machines management

Management of contract wide settings, such as stablecoin liquidity, liquidity withdrawals and deposits, fee collecting, linked machines management and whitelisted tokens.

### 3. Machines and contract analytics

Transaction explorer, contract information, and custom charts to display the most relevent information of a contract and its machines.
