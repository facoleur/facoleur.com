title: Building Athena, an ecommerce product manager & repricer
snippet: When I co-founded SyncAI, the first product we built was Athena, a product manager and repricer tool for Swiss marketplaces.

technologies: [Typescript, React, Figma]

I designed and developed the frontend for monitoring products, analyzing the performance of the repricer, and managing shipping rules and product data health.

It was built with TypeScript and React using Next.js. The stack includes Tailwind CSS for styling, Axios with a custom fetcher, React Query for data fetching and caching, Recharts for charts, TanStack Table for datatables, Radix UI for components, and Zustand for state management.

## Technical details

#### Backend integration

The backend was built with Django, which returned snake_case keys. To align with established TypeScript conventions, I implemented a custom Axios instance with interceptors that converted keys to camelCase on the fly, while handling exceptions such as Django's nested filter keys using double underscores.

#### Filtering system and data tables

To enable efficient search across hundreds of products, I built a flexible filtering system with multiple combinable filters, managed through a [Zustand store](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) and synchronized with the UI. I also developed a reusable filter component that supported number, text, select, multiselect, and boolean filters, automatically adapting its behavior to the filter type.

![Charts](/assets/athena/filters.jpg)

I implemented a full featured datatable with column visibility, pagination and global search. The datatable was integrated with [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to manage loading states and cache data, and to invalidate queries when filters or parameters changed.

#### Charts

I first implemented charts with Plotly but later refactored to [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for better integration with React. I built custom chart components supporting multi line, bar, grouped bar, and scatter charts, with attention to responsiveness and interactivity. Chart data was cached when possible using React Query.

#### Authentication and roles

Athena supports customer, admin, and sales roles. The sales role was a custom role with backoffice access to supplier data across marketplaces.

#### Testing

I wrote unit tests for critical components using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), focusing on the filtering system, datatable, and chart components. End to end testing was handled with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) in a separate repository, integrated with CI/CD to run on every push and send notifications to Slack.

## Bottom line

Athena's frontend brought together complex data handling, interactive visualization, and role based access into a single application, making it a reliable tool for managing products and pricing on Swiss marketplaces.
