In June 2023, I decided to do the 42 piscine experience, an intense 1 month deep dive into C programming, conceived to select the most motivated and capable potential student for 42 school. Despite working +10 hours a day for 30 days without any break, it was one of the most fulfilling experience of my life, both socially and educationally.

When I received the results that I was selected for the school, I didn't hesitate a second and I registered for the nearest start date. In october, I started the exciting journey of 42 Lausanne.

Here are the reason I choose to go to 42 school, even it doesn't deliver any accredited diploma.

## The hidden value of peer-to-peer learning

42 School has no teacher. How are we supposed to learn programming? Everyone share the same open space, students that already finished the common core as well as total beginner like me in october 2023.

At 42, students are encouraged to adopt a proactive approach to learning. It's commonplace to stand up, walk over to someone's desk, and engage in conversation, seeking help, advice, or simply discussing their current projects. This collaborative atmosphere is central to the learning process.

On top of traditional learning venues for programming, like youtube videos and tutorials, stack overflow forums, wikipedia pages, various online articles and of course ChatGPT, the real magic happens through comparing solutions, discussing ideas, and debating the merits of different implementations. It's through this constant exchange, this perpetual brainstorming, that we become programmers with an innate sense of collaboration. It's not just about learning to code; it's about evolving as collaborative thinkers and problem solvers, skills invaluable in the modern world of programming.

## The flexibility to go at your own pace

At 42, the educational model is uniquely flexible, designed to adapt to individual schedules rather than the other way around. This approach recognizes that everyone has different capabilities and personal commitments. Whether it's family, work, or other activities, being able to progress at your own pace is invaluable.

At 42, the flexibility to tailor your learning pace allows you to integrate education smoothly into your life. It's not merely about different learning styles; it's about adapting to the complexities of each student's life, enabling a balanced educational experience alongside personal and professional responsibilities.

Thanks to this flexibilty, I am able to continue my UIUX freelance activities along with learning programming.

## The wide range of people

The thing that impressed me the most about this school was the diversity of backgrounds. Locals, foreigners from every corner of the world, young people, older people, entrepreneurs, university students, I've never seen so much diversity in one place, and that's a huge strength of the school.

A few atypical profiles who started 42 at the same time as me:

- J, 29, master's degree in biology
- E. 45, cosmetics entrepreneur
- L. 22, Bachelor's student in Business Administration and Fitness coach
- B. 31, musician (we call him Shazam)
- M. 32, currently retraining and father of a little boy

## Starting from scratch ensure building a deep understanding

Knowing a bit more about computer science and programming, I've come to recognize that there are effective and less effective ways to learn programming. It's challenging to know where to begin, especially with the allure of jumping straight into the latest trends like Python's machine learning libraries or the React framework. However, by doing so, one might overlook the crucial foundational knowledge of how a computer operates, including the intricacies of resource management or algorithms implementation.

Some might argue that understanding resources management or basic algorithms is unnecessary, as modern languages and technologies handle these aspects. However, I don't believe that's the case. Knowing the fundamentals allows for deeper understanding and more effective problem-solving, even when advanced tools do much of the heavy lifting.

## So why did I choose 42 ?

To wrap up, here are the main reasons I chose to go to 42 Lausanne

- **In-depth Learning:** To grasp the essentials of computer science, particularly in memory management and algorithm development.
- **Flexible Pacing:** To study at a pace that suits my personal and work commitments.
- **Diverse Network:** To connect with individuals from varied backgrounds, enriching my learning and future opportunities.
- **Collaborative Culture:** To cultivate a natural inclination for teamwork, essential in the tech industry.
