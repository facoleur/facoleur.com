Back in the day, I used to struggle to find the perfect words for my sentences. I would use Deepl to go back and forth translating between French and English, testing synonyms for every word. It helped me improve my writing, but it was time-consuming.

Now, with AI, things are different.

Let's be clear: content that is purely AI-generated is boring and generic. That's not what I do, and that's not what I'm advocating.

I start by writing a rough draft.
It's messy, the sentences aren't perfect, and the wording might feel clunky; but that's the strength of it. I focus on ideas, not form. I write fast, capturing everything I want to say.

Then, I bring in AI. With just a few prompts, it can rephrase sentences, simplify complex wording, and offer multiple alternatives much faster than I ever could. I don't let AI write for me, I let it refine with me.

I still go back and forth, sentence by sentence, making sure the flow and connections between ideas feel natural. But the entire process takes me five times less time than before.

I write more.
I post more.
And I focus more on the ideas — which is what really matters.

Simplicity, after all, is the true reflection of intelligence.
