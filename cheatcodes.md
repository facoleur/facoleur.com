CHEAT CODE 1

Most companies still treat their blogs like a place to dump updates. AI engines now reward content that is structured, factual and comparative, not generic filler.

AI engines prefer:

Clean HTML
Clear hierarchy
Factual and data backed statements
Comparisons and buyer guidance
Consistent updates

Publish formats such as:

Best of lists featuring your product or service
Competitor comparisons
Buyer guides with pricing and feature breakdowns
Use case or category pages written for decision makers

This is exactly what our main plans produce:

Gold Plan: 10 long form articles and 3 DR50 backlinks

CHEAT CODE 2

AI systems favor content that is easy to parse.

Use:

Clear H2s with intent driven keywords
Bullet lists where possible
Short TLDR summaries at the top
FAQs that mirror real user questions
Internal links that explain relationships between your pages

Mentioning competitors increases topic relevance and raises the odds of being cited alongside them.

CHEAT CODE 3

Freshness is now one of the strongest signals for AI citations.

Update main pages every 30 to 60 days.
Add a visible last updated line in the HTML.
Refresh the top 150 words with a new example or FAQ.

Google AI Overviews and Gemini now give preference to pages with fresh visible updates. Perplexity also pulls recent content more frequently than older URLs.

CHEAT CODE 4

Use the page structure that consistently earns citations:

Keyword rich title
TLDR box or summary paragraph
Intro that answers the main question immediately
H2s broken into categories, tools or use cases
Bulleted lists for pricing, pros, cons or features
Screenshots, examples or proof
FAQ section at the end with schema when possible

CHEAT CODE 5

Strengthen your brand’s entity clarity.

Do this:

Create an About or Brand Facts page with consistent details
Add a .well known brand facts JSON file
Keep organization schema consistent on all pages
Reference your brand the same way across platforms and directories

This helps AI systems confidently associate your content with your brand and cite you as a source.

CHEAT CODE 6

AI platforms now weigh context from external mentions.

Publish short posts, explainers or testimonials on trusted third party sites such as Reddit, Medium, or niche blogs. Mention your brand next to your target keyword. Link them back to your primary pages.

This builds the semantic footprint AI engines use to determine authority.

CHEAT CODE 7

Use clearly labeled summaries that AI parsers understand.

Use section or aside tags labeled as summary.
Write short, direct sentences.
Add outbound references at the end.

CHEAT CODE 8

You do not need to rewrite entire articles.
Update the top 150 words and add one new FAQ or example near the top every 30 to 45 days.
This preserves URL history while signaling freshness.

CHEAT CODE 9

Perplexity and Gemini now filter pages that appear overly promotional before engagement builds.

Lead with information, not sales.
Place CTAs after the main content.
Use internal links to educational pages first.
